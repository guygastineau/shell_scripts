# shell_scripts
bash tools for ~/bin

## Organization
Scripts should be in their own dir with their own README.md
those dirs should be in dirs set to a corresponding category

- each category dir may or may not have a README.md but having
  one is preferred
- each script of a category should contain similar functionality
  -  can deal with pipes or read whole files as arguments
- non-bash scripts should be contained in directories 
  specifying the language; eg. perl, ruby, python, etc...
  
## Participation
I will consider pull requests, but I will probably remain the sole maintainer

- feel free to clone this repo or remake it **EVERYTHING IS FREE**
- no files that give private or system information to the public will be merged

## Credit
Please give credit when due. I will try to do the same.

## Scope
This repo shouldn't be taken super seriously

- this repo just a fun place to store shell_scripts and executables
  that are convenient or fun
- I will make no considerable effort to standardize beyond the 
  aforementioned guidelines, or to automate the generation of
  documentation
- this could be a good place for scripts that anyone might want
  to grab while on a foreign machine (although I think it is better
  for .bashrc's to live somewhere else for individual users)
