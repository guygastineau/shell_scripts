# shell_scripts
bash tools for ~/bin

## Organization
Scripts should be in their own dir with their own README.md
those dirs should be in dirs set to a corresponding category.

- Each category dir may or may not have a README.md but having
  one is preferred.
- Each script of a category should contain similar functionality.
  -  example: can deal with pipes or read whole files as arguments
- Non-bash scripts should be contained in directories 
  specifying the language; eg. perl, ruby, python, etc...
  
## Participation
I will consider pull requests, but I will probably remain the sole maintainer.
(if you actively contribute and really want to maintain I will
probably consider it)

- Feel free to clone this repo or remake it **EVERYTHING IS FREE**.
- No files that give private or system information to the public will be merged.

## Credit
Please give credit when due. I will try to do the same.

## Scope
This repo shouldn't be taken super seriously

- This repo just a fun place to store shell_scripts and executables
  that are convenient or fun.
- I will make neither considerable effort to standardize beyond the 
  aforementioned guidelines nor to automate the generation of
  documentation.
- This could be a good place for scripts that anyone might want
  to grab while on a foreign machine. (although I think it is better
  for .bashrc's to live somewhere else for individual users)
