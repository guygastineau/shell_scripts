# Ciphers Category
This directory is for different implementations of ciphers

## Conventions
All contributions to this category should follow basic conventions
for the type of cipher and the following program functionality:

- should be able to encode or decode with a flag or command name
- should be able to read a string or multiline file as an argument
- should be able to accept piped strings or files

## Philosophy
All implementations of ciphers should prefer resource lightness for
longer encryptions over academic exploration of mathematics.

I like implementing full decryption functions too but they aren't
appropriate for executables.  If there is a push for it then we
can create playground spaces for exploring the academic side of 
these ciphers, but lets keep it clean and fast here!
